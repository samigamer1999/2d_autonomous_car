# 2D autonomous car
This is a 2D autonomous car simulation I made as a school project using Python, Neural networks, a genetic algorithm
and gradient descent.

## Getting Started
Clone the file to you prefered directory, and launch the Main.py script to see the evolution of a genetic algorithm,
or MainGr.py to see the gradient descent algorithm perform.
